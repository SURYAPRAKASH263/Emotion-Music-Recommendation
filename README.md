# Emotion-Music-Recommendation
This project leverages deep learning (DNN/CNN) and OpenCV to detect user emotions through facial expressions and recommend music accordingly. By analyzing real-time video input, the model classifies emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) and suggests mood-appropriate songs from a curated playlist.

Key Features:

- Emotion Detection using CNN with OpenCV for facial analysis
- Music Recommendation powered by DNN classifiers
- Real-time Processing for seamless user experience
- Customizable Playlists based on detected moods
